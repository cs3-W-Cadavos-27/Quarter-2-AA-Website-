                    <p>We are very glad of the significant funding from the national government that has made the 13th campus of the PSHS System a lucky one. The Pisay Caraga family is thankful to Dr. Ruwina D. Gonzaga, the former Campus Director, for leading all the efforts in initially building the campus. We also thank former DOST Secretary Engr. Mario G. Montejo for the huge funding to initially build the campus and the current DOST Secretary Fortunato T. de la Pe√±a for the continued support. We thank the Members of the Board of Trustees, Executive Director Lilia T. Habacon and the members of the Executive Committee for all the support. <br><br>Caraga Region is very rich in natural resources and needs to develop the needed human resource to drive the regional economy. We need science and technology to improve productivity and build the new industries of the Region. The role of science and technology in national and regional development becomes critically important in this era known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution. As our country aims to become more competitive globally, the government invested more in STEM education. Thus the presence of Pisay Caraga in Butuan City, the regional center,  is strategic. We envision Pisay Caraga as an exponent of regional development. <br><br>We commit to work together with our partners in implementing quality STEM education that will benefit the Filipinos, especially the Caraganons. We shall scour the entire Caraga Region for talented students in order to spread the impact of science and technology. What Caraga Region needs is greater value of its rich natural resources. The creation of new industries  and the making of a competitive and sustainable Region requires a great human capital, and this is where Philippine Science High School can effectively contribute. </p>
